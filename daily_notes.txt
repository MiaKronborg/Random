- lab meeting: Goldbogen article on lunge feeding in humpback whales
- MatlabHelpdesk: How window size in spectrogram influences the results (script: three_ways_of_psd01_spectrogram.m)
- GitHub usage: How to use GitHub with Matlab. It is possible to run the bash commands from Matlab initiating the command with ! 
- Using GitHub through Matlab:
	- Navigate to repo
	- !git status (to see if anything needs to be staged)
	- !git add file-name.m 
	- !git commit -m "the comment you want to add"
- Tried setting up GitHub on the web-page, but did not work until i used: git remote set-url URL-address (followed by: git push -u origin master)
	- BUT from the GitHub desktop the 'publish function' allows to fetch and push
